# CapacitanceMeter
Arduino sketch associated with the Capacitance Meter Using the NE555 Timer blog   post on https://lagacemichel.com

Capacitance computed using a known resistor network and a 555 Timer IC configured in astable mode. The capacitance
is displayed on a liquid crystal display directly connected to the Arduino board. Precise time measurement is achieved
using the Arduino interrupt on edge capability.
